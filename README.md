 John Layher's JavaScript Project 3
 I would like to be graded in regards to the "Exceeds Expectations"
 criteria.  If my project does not meet the requirements for the "Exceeds
 Expectations" grade, I would like to give this project another shot.  I
 would like my project to be rejected in the case that my work does not
 meet all of the "Exceeds Expectations" requirements.
