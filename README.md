# Interactive-Form App

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional "FullStack Conference."  

To assist with user-friendliness, I added:
- custom conditional behavior and interactivity
- validation checks on user inputs to ensure the form was filled out correctly and that no signed up events coincided
- real time error messages.

To run this program, drag and drop the index.html file into your local browser.
